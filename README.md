# Computer_vision explanation

## Several exercise link to computer vision and object detecion. 

Each Machine Learning problem requires it's own metrics, and whereas some metrics like accuracy. We will develop an exercise which develops the IoU or Intesection Over Union which is a measure used to evaluate the performance of an algorithm in detecting objects within an image.
