# Basics on Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## AI, ML and DL

Artificial Intelligence (AI): a system that leverages information from its environment to make decisions. For example, a video game bot. 

Machine Learning (ML): an AI subset that does not need to be explicity programmed and instead learns from data. For example, a spam classification algorithm.

Deep Learning (DL): a subset of ML algorithms that do not require handcrafted features and can work with raw data. For example, an object detection algorithm with a convolutional neural network. 

## Machine learning approaches:

Supervides learning (labeled training datasets): Feature -> Target | Images laveled with type of animals. Full control of networks
