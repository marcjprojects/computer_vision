# Basics on Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## AI, ML and DL

Artificial Intelligence (AI): a system that leverages information from its environment to make decisions. For example, a video game bot. 

Machine Learning (ML): an AI subset that does not need to be explicity programmed and instead learns from data. For example, a spam classification algorithm.

Deep Learning (DL): a subset of ML algorithms that do not require handcrafted features and can work with raw data. For example, an object detection algorithm with a convolutional neural network. 

## Machine learning approaches:

Supervised learning (labeled training datasets): Feature -> Target | Images laveled with type of animals. Full control of networks.

Unsupervised learning : unlabeled training dataset. We don't specify the target. For example, we show images but we don't label them as a got or dog.

Reinforcement learning : training on a seqence of states. It trains by itself based on rewards. 

## Perceptron.py

A perceptron is an artificial neuron, essential for Deep Learning neural networks. The output is based on inputs and weights. 
Output = x*w0 + y*w1 + z*w2 which most basic function used is the step function.
